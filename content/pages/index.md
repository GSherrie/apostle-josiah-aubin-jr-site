      <h2 class="about-title">Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr., PhD</h2>
      <p>
        Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr. is a devoted servant of God and an influential voice in contemporary
        Christian leadership. He serves as the General Overseer of Impact City Church (formerly Power
        Victory Chapel), a ministry rooted in deep spiritual heritage and committed to transforming
        lives through the power of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born into a family with a strong spiritual legacy, Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr. carries forward the
        vision entrusted to him by his father, the late Rev. Josiah Aubin Sr., with passion, clarity,
        and God-ordained purpose. Under his leadership, the church embraced a new identity as Impact
        City Church, reflecting a prophetic calling to be “a city on a hill,” shining Christ’s light
        across families, communities, and nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apostle Aubin is more than a pastor — he is a teacher, communicator, and leader whose ministry
        bridges spiritual insight with practical life application. His teachings resonate with
        believers eager to grow in faith, deepen their relationship with God, and walk confidently in
        their calling. A PhD holder in Church Administration, and a gifted author and conference
        speaker, he has penned books that encourage
        believers to persevere in faith and maintain a fervent spiritual walk, even in times of
        adversity.

      Before answering the call to full-time ministry, he cultivated a strong foundation in the
      marketplace, demonstrating excellence as a financial analyst and entrepreneur. In January 2017,
      he made the life-changing decision to leave a promising banking career to pursue ministry with
      total obedience to God’s direction, exemplifying his commitment to God’s plan above all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr.’s leadership is marked by vision, devotion, and an unwavering
      commitment to holistic transformation — inspiring believers to live purposefully and impact
      their world with the love of Christ. He is also a devoted family man, walking life’s journey
      with his wife, Mrs. Rita Aubin, and their daughter.
