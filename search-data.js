View Books Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr., PhD Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr. is a devoted servant of God and an influential voice in contemporary Christian leadership. He serves as the General Overseer of Impact City Church (formerly Power Victory Chapel), a ministry rooted in deep spiritual heritage and committed to transforming lives through the power of Christ. Born into a family with a strong spiritual legacy, Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr. carries forward the vision entrusted to him by his father, the late Rev. Josiah Aubin Sr., with passion, clarity, and God-ordained purpose. Under his leadership, the church embraced a new identity as Impact City Church, reflecting a prophetic calling to be \u201ca city on a hill,\u201d shining Christ\u2019s light across families, communities, and nations. Apostle Aubin is more than a pastor \u2014 he is a teacher, communicator, and leader whose ministry bridges spiritual insight with practical life application. His teachings resonate with believers eager to grow in faith, deepen their relationship with God, and walk confidently in their calling. A PhD holder in Church Administration, and a gifted author and conference speaker, he has penned books that encourage believers to persevere in faith and maintain a fervent spiritual walk, even in times of adversity. Before answering the call to full-time ministry, he cultivated a strong foundation in the marketplace, demonstrating excellence as a financial analyst and entrepreneur. In January 2017, he made the life-changing decision to leave a promising banking career to pursue ministry with total obedience to God\u2019s direction, exemplifying his commitment to God\u2019s plan above all else. Today, Apostle Josiah Aubin Jr.\u2019s leadership is marked by vision, devotion, and an unwavering commitment to holistic transformation \u2014 inspiring believers to live purposefully and impact their world with the love of Christ. He is also a devoted family man, walking life\u2019s journey with his wife, Mrs. Rita Aubin, and their daughter.
